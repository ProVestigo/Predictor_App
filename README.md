# Predictor_App
Data analysis programm that predicts users keystrokes

Give the program random zeros and ones until it stops prompting you. The program will then use this data to predict your keystrokes and award you $1 for outsmarting the prediction or take $1 from your $1000 
starting balance. 

Unfortunately the program will updated its predictions every time you enter anything so ultimately you're doomed, but it's fun in the meantime.
